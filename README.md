**A Java Implementation of an L1-Regularized Spline Process**

![global temperature data](crutem3.png "L1 spline of annual temperates")

Typically splines for noisy signal reconstruction are regularized with
a weighted L2 term, resulting from the least-squares fitting
motivation. Tepper and Sapiro[1] describe an efficient numerical scheme
for using an L1 term instead, yielding better robustness to outliers.

I have implemented the described algorithm in Java, using the
[ND4J](https://nd4j.org/index.html) library, which uses a BLAS backend
for matrix computations, and can also be configured to use a CUDA
backend for offloading computation onto fast graphics card hardware.

Effectively this code presents an efficient API for a more robust
L1-based spline processing of signals to the JVM, suitable for
JVM-based applications running on servers, gpus, desktops, or even
Android phones.

The chart above shows a spline generated by this code with L1
regularization on annual global temperature data from the Met Office
Hadley Centre.[2] _Note that the dataset itself has been deprecated by
the center and is only used here as an illustration of the
implementation of the algorithm._
